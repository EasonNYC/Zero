ZERO
===========
Author: Eason Smith (Eason@EasonRobotics.com)

Zero is a personal assistant A.I. written in python 2.7. It is intended to be run on a linux system with satelite units to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi.

The goal of Zero is to be a portable, networked A.I. assistant available across the home.

Currently, Zero supports text to speech and is still very much a work in progress.
